# Leader reports, direction, and proposal races

**Leader Baton prepares an execution suggestion while native consensus keeps moving.** It closes a report window, uses Baton::plan to choose a valid direction, and disseminates the result. Native Core may freeze a proposal before Baton planning finishes.

## Leader lifecycle: collect reports and disseminate direction

        Note over L,X: No direction vote / ACK / Ready quorum
        L->>L: Local cycle closes, fresh work / context starts next cycle
    and Native cut path
        N->>N: Prepared matching policy or valid NativeBase
        Note over N,L: Cut does not wait for report count / deadline / Baton planning completion
        N->>N: Freeze authenticated proposal policy, native votes
    end

Window announcement and binding prepared policy to an actual proposal require integration adapters. The diagram does not imply those APIs already exist or prefix adoption has been proved. Closing a local cycle does not wait for all nodes' execution or the native cut branch to finish.

## Planning completion versus proposal freeze

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant L as Leader Baton
    participant P as Baton: planning task
    participant N as Native leader proposal owner
    participant V as Native validators
    L->>P: Frozen reports / exact planning context
    alt Evaluated candidate reaches owner before proposal freeze
        P-->>L: PreparedPolicy(context, validity material)
        L-->>N: Cached prepared policy for actual-context recheck
        N->>N: Recheck actual parent / history / frontier / request correlation
        alt Recheck admits candidate for this actual proposal
            N->>N: Freeze selected prefix and policy before signing
        else Context or admissibility recheck fails
            N->>N: Use actual-parent valid NativeBase before adoption
        end
    else Candidate is stale, unavailable, or unfinished
        N->>N: Use actual-parent valid NativeBase before adoption
    end
    N-->>V: Authenticated native proposal with fixed interpretation
    V-->>N: Native proposal votes
    opt Late planning result / new report / larger native pool
        P-->>L: Late prepared result
        L-->>N: Current cache, no mutation of frozen proposal
        N->>N: Do not mutate this proposal policy
    end
    Note over L,V: Native votes are not a direction-reply quorum

Native proposal can use the valid actual-parent base path even when no planning job exists. The diagram describes the completion race when a job has been started.

Availability for adopting a prepared result and exact-prefix preservation remain unresolved. This diagram identifies the required freeze boundary without adopting a particular ready-only policy variant. On view change, old reports and advisory work cannot enter the new context. Already authenticated, emitted, or applied history keeps its original interpretation.
